Things I am passionate about
-------------------------

-   I love well structured data and have worked the last three years with RDF and Linked Data in a project that has similarities to Solid. I did some bounties for [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/) and [PLDN](https://github.com/pldn/LDWizard/issues/59).
-   I enjoy giving talks at meetups and getting into contact with other enthusiastic programmers.
-   In past jobs I enjoyed it a lot to coach interns. I love the interactions and it is very fulfilling to see people built stuff and to see them grow.
