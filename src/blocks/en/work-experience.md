### Lead Developer at _Fonkel_

*Oct 2012 - May 2018*

</div>

-   Led a team of 3 to 6 developers in creating various Drupal and JavaScript applications, including interactive geographic maps and content-heavy multilingual Drupal sites.
-   Worked with the Dutch Tax Ministry on prototyping and implementing a tool for insights into people and organizations from various sources. This tool is used by more than 5 departments of the Dutch Tax Ministry.
- Created various Drupal modules and published those to drupal.org.
- Created a calculation tool for the Dutch carpentry branch to draw and then calculate the warmth loss of wooden panels, doors and windows. This was done together with a person who understood all the technical details from the carpentry perspective and one other programmer.
- Did various design sprints, one was for a startup in the aviation industry and one for the Dutch Tax ministry.

> I can highly recommend Daniel. Technically he is exceptionally skilled, fast and diverse. He actually has all the skills you look for in a full-fledged development team, from the architecture of an application to the details in the design. Not only are the front-end and back-end in good hands with Dani√´l, he also absorbs domain knowledge of the projects he works on, which allows him to really think along and understand how technology and practice can best come together. Dani√´l is also very good at communicating, he brings energy, humor and inspiration to a team.
>
> My career started under Dani√´l's guidance. I owe part of my own success to his good guidance, because he was able to deal well with my eagerness to learn and nourished it by explaining technical concepts calmly and in detail from start to finish. In terms of self-development, I have always benefited (and still do) from Dani√´l applying a healthy mix of giving constructive feedback and clearly indicating when you are on the wrong track.
>
> Together we worked at the same agency for about 5 years on various projects, from large Drupal websites to complex JavaScript applications. That was always very pleasant to work with. If you had the feeling that a part was going to be technically very complicated, Dani√´l regularly had a proof-of-concept running within a week. We never stopped at fantasizing about next-level solutions, we just did it and took up the challenge. Since then we have remained in close contact and help each other regularly. Whoever Dani√´l's next employer and colleagues may be, you will benefit enormously from his presence and craftsmanship!

> During the period from 2012 to 2018, Daniel worked as a lead developer at Fonkel. During that time he made a significant contribution not only in the products we realized for our clients, but also in the development of the company. 
> 
> Daniel was a very loyal and carrying force in the team. He is what I call a creative developer, by not only programming the solution, but also making a very important contribution in conceiving and (technically) designing the solution. 
> 
> Often his creative contribution made a significant difference in the value delivered to the customer. Not always the solution that was requested, but certainly the solution that was needed. I highly recommend Daniel.
