About me
---------------

As a software engineer I love to solve problems for people 🧑 and organizations 💼. 

I am a generalist and always eager to learn new technologies 🚀. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I learned that communication skills 💬 are at least equally as important as the programming skills. 

Most of the time I have a side project I am working on, from an app to showcase [the influence of philosophers](https://influence.danielbeeke.nl) to an app that tells if you should [walk or run](https://ov.danielbeeke.nl) to catch the next bus 🏃.

Outside of work I like to create things; songs on my guitar, 3d popup cards or woodworking. Since 4 years I am married  to Wilma. She is a graphic designer, sometimes we do a side project together like an app to easily create maps for perma culture gardening 🌿.
