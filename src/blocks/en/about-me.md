About me
---------------

I am a software engineer that loves to solve problems for people and organizations. 

I am a generalist and love to learn new technologies. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I learned that communication skills are at least equally as important as the programming skills. 

I am always looking for the next side project, from an app to showcase [the influence of philosophers](https://influence.danielbeeke.nl) to an app that tells if you should [walk or run](https://ov.danielbeeke.nl) to catch the next bus.
