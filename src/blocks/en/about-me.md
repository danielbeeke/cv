About me
---------------

I am a software engineer that loves to solve problems for people 🧑 and organizations 💼. 

I am a generalist and love to learn new technologies 🚀. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I learned that communication skills 💬 are at least equally as important as the programming skills. 

I am always looking for the next side project, from an app to showcase [the influence of philosophers](https://influence.danielbeeke.nl) to an app that tells if you should [walk or run](https://ov.danielbeeke.nl) to catch the next bus 🏃.
