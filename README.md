About me
---------------

I am a software engineer that loves to solve problems for people and organizations. 

I am a generalist and love to learn new technologies. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I learned that communication skills are at least equally as important as the programming skills. 

I am always looking for the next side project, from an app to showcase [the influence of philosophers](https://influence.danielbeeke.nl) to an app that tells if you should [walk or run](https://ov.danielbeeke.nl) to catch the next bus.

Things I am passionate about
-------------------------

-   I love well structured data and have worked the last three years with RDF and Linked Data in a project that has similarities to Solid. I did some bounties for [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/) and [PLDN](https://github.com/pldn/LDWizard/issues/59).
-   I enjoy giving talks at meetups and getting into contact with other enthusiastic programmers.
-   In past jobs I enjoyed it a lot to coach interns. I love the interactions and it is very fulfilling to see people built stuff and to see them grow.
