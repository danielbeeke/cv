        <section class="about-me"><h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello I am Daniël Beeke, a software engineer that loves to solve problems for people and organizations. I am an autodidact and love to learn and pass on knowledge.</p>
<p>I would love to work in a team that is able to pull off difficult tasks because of their great skills but also their team culture and relationships. I can fit in various roles as listed and I am the happiest when I can be close to the code and work together with colleagues.</p>
<p>I am a generalist and love to learn new technologies. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I have learned that communication skills might be more or at least equally as important as the programming skills.</p>
<p>I would love to work in a place where there is a high level of skills and because of that good relationships with customers. I want to work at a place where the customer pays for hours and not for products. I believe very strongly in giving transparency as the only real reliable way of steering a project into the right way. Estimations are sometimes necessary but they can be quite misleading. And I have learned that along the way.</p>
<p>I am a systems thinker, which helps me when creating architecture. In my spare time I have dabbled with creating popup cards (the foldable ones) and some woodworking. I play guitar and ukulele.</p></section>
