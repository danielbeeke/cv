        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello I am Daniël Beeke, a software engineer that loves to solve problems for people and organizations. I love to learn and pass on knowledge.</p>
        <p>I am a generalist and love to learn new technologies. I can rapidly code together prototypes and proof if an idea might work. Over the years I have learned that communication skills might be more or at least equally as important as the programming skills.</p>
        <p>I am always looking for the next side project, from an app to showcase
          <a href="https://influence.danielbeeke.nl">the influence of philosophers</a>
          to an app that tells if you should
          <a href="https://ov.danielbeeke.nl">walk or run</a>
          to catch the next bus.</p>
